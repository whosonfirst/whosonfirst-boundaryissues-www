Boundary Issues is a web-application for editing Who's On First data.

## Important

There is no application yet. We'll get there.

We're investigating various approaches, which you can observe on the following branches:
* [flask](https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-www-boundaryissues/tree/flask)
* [flamework](https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-www-boundaryissues/tree/flamework)

In the meantime, have a gander at the [specification](https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-www-boundaryissues/blob/master/SPEC.md) or the document describing [updating things](https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-www-boundaryissues/blob/master/UPDATE.md).
