Hello!

tl;dr we’d like to invite you to try out our Who’s On First gazetteer editor,
called Boundary Issues. If you know what that is, scroll down to “What next?”

At Mapzen we believe that places make everything better. We’d like to invite you
to help us define the places that are most important to you and your work. Our
global, open data gazetteer (a big list of places) is called Who’s On First [1]
(also known as WOF, pronounced “woff”). WOF currently has around 26 million
records, and has been designed with some interesting features. Each place record
is encoded in a flexible text-based format (GeoJSON [2]), each has a stable
numeric identifier, and historical snapshots of a place can be described through
a series of pointers. WOF records include structured place hierarchies that
describe how one place is contained by others (e.g., Drawn & Quarterly [3] is a
bookstore in Montréal, which is in Quebec).

To make editing WOF records easier, we are working on a web-based editor called
Boundary Issues [4]) and we would love it if you’d try it out, and send us your
feedback.

We have been sourcing our data from a variety of other projects, but we also
produce our own records and add pointers to other sources; we call these
“concordances.” We could use your help identifying and fixing those places that
may be missing or outdated. As an open data commons, any improvements made by
one user benefit all. You could use WOF as an open data rolodex. If your website
includes pages about the venues in our dataset, they could draw from the WOF
record to automatically display their details, such as photos, hours, which
neighborhood it’s in.

Please let us know if Boundary Issues is helpful for your work, or *if it isn't*
how we might make improvements that are relevant to your needs.

What next?

1. If you don’t have an account already, you will need to sign up for GitHub:
   https://github.com/join (this requirement will be removed eventually).
2. Click on this invite link: {$cfg.abs_root_url}invite/{$invite.code|escape}/
3. Accept the terms, etc.
4. Try searching for a place
5. If you don’t find what you’re looking, try adding a new place
6. Explore around and try editing some existing records

If you get stuck or have questions, bug reports, general feedback, complaints,
or ecstatic praise, get in touch with Dan Phiffer at dan@mapzen.com.
